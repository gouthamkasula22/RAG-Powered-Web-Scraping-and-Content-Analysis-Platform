### Usage Examples

**Single URL Analysis**
```python
# Quick analysis example
result = await analyze_url("https://example.com", "comprehensive")
print(f"Executive Summary: {result.insights['executive_summary']}")
print(f"SEO Score: {result.metrics['seo_score']}")
```

**RAG Knowledge Queries**
```python
# Natural language querying
response = await query_knowledge_repository(
    "What are the main technical challenges mentioned across all analyzed websites?"
)
print(response.answer)
```

**Bulk Processing**
```python
# Process multiple URLs efficiently
urls = ["https://site1.com", "https://site2.com", "https://site3.com"]
results = await bulk_analyze(urls, max_concurrent=5)
```

### Performance Metrics

- **Analysis Speed**: Average 15-30 seconds per comprehensive analysis
- **Concurrent Processing**: Supports up to 10 simultaneous analyses
- **Database Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming processing for large content volumes
- **API Response Times**: Sub-second response for most endpoints
